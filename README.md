Scripts for Powershell
Remote Delete Profile Tool lets  you connect to a remote PC on your network (assuming you have admin rights) and you can then delete profiles off that PC.
Switch Access Tool is a basic GUI to select a network switch by name (have it populate IP) then select a username and populate that ID. the connect button runs a SSH command that connects you to the switch.
